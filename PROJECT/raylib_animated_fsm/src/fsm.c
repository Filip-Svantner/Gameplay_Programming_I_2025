 * @object: Poor divil whose state is getting set up, hope its not STATE_DEAD.
 * @state:  Which state is being configuring (STATE_IDLE, STATE_WALKING, STATE_BOOZED (actually BOOZED not allowed LOL etc.)
 * @name:   Grand little STATE label
 * @HandleEvent: Function to deal with any events fired at this state
 * @Entry:  Runs when the object enters the state ... a sort of "Dia duit".
 * @Update: Runs each frame while in the state ... "is she buring in Oil?", "she would if she got it!"
 * @Exit:   Runs when hopping out out out out out of a state ... a polite "Slan leat".
